INTRODUCTION
============

No individual assembly algorithm addresses all the known limitations 
of assembling short length sequences. Overall reduced sequence contig 
length is the major problem that challenges the usage of these assemblies. 
GAA is designed to take advantages of different assembly algorithms or 
sequencing platforms to improve the quality of next-generation sequence 
(NGS) assemblies.


PREREQUISITES
=============

Perl => 5.8.9
Sequence aligners: BLAT GSMapper


INSTALLATION
====

The program is tested under LINUX systems. Below command could install 
the GAA package.
export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:path_to_the_gaa_package


COMMAND LINE
============
	
Run gaa.pl without any parameter, it will print below usage on the screen.
	
-.pl	--target|-t 		<target.fa>		 : target consensus file, the contig names should be in the format of >Contig1.1
    	--query|-q 		<query.fa> 		 : query  consensus file, the contig names should be in the format of >Contig1.1
    	
The following options are optional.
    	--target-qual|-T 	<target.qual.fa> 	 : target quality file
    	--query-qual|-Q 	<query.qual.fa> 	 : query quality file
	--target_gap|-g         <target gap file>	 : e.g. gap.txt for Newbler
	--query_gap|-G          <query gap file>	 : e.g. gap.txt for Newbler
    	--match|-m 		<alignment.psl>          : blat target.fa query.fa -fastMap query_vs_target.psl
    	
	--pair_status_target|r	<454PairStatus.txt>	 : generated from GSMapper
	--pair_status_query|R	<454PairStatus.txt>	 : generated from GSMapper
    	--ce                    <ce.psl>          	 : ce status psl file

    	--output-dir|-o 	<output_dir=pwd> 	 : default is merged_assembly under current directory
    	--tip-size|-p 		<tip_size=90>		 : tip tolerance 
    	--score-cutoff-lower|-l	<score_cutoff_lower=30>	 : confident unique contig, if score < 30
    	--score-cutoff-upper|-u	<score-cutoff_upper=100> : confident match,         if score > 100
    	--contig-size-cutoff|-s	<contig_size_cutoff=100> : keep unique contigs of length > 100
	Using -m option would shortcut the alignment step if alignment.psl alread exists.


EXAMPLES
========

> ./gaa.pl -t newbler.fa -q cabog.fa
Merge newbler.fa and cabog.fa, and output newbler.fa_n_cabog.fa as the merged assembly to:

> ./gaa.pl -t newbler.fa -q cabog.fa -T newbler.qual -Q cabog.qual
Also generate a quality file (newbler.qual_n_cabog.qual) for the merged assembly.

> ./gaa.pl -t newbler.fa -q cabog.fa -t newbler.gap
Generate the gap file (g.gap) for merged assembly.
